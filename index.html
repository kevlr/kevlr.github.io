  <h1>Getting started</h1>
  <p>Kevlr is a responsive front-end framework based on <a href="http://sass-lang.com">Sass</a>. This framework is not made to built prototypes looking all the same but it's made to built real websites with their own visual identity.</p>
  <a href="https://github.com/vescoyez/framework-css" class="button">Get the code on Github</a>
  
  <h2>Beta</h2>
  <p>For now Kevlr is still in Beta, all the features aren't here yet and maybe you'll encounter some bug. If that happend please <a href="https://github.com/vescoyez/framework-css/issues">let us know</a></p>
  
  <h2>Sass</h2>
  <p>This framework uses Sass, if you don't know how to use it, please visit <a href="http://sass-lang.com">their website</a>. You don't need to understand everything but if you get how works the variables and mixins, it will be easier.</p>
  
  <h2>Variables</h2>
  <p>The most important file in Kevlr is the '<a href="https://github.com/vescoyez/framework-css/blob/master/scss/variables.scss">variables.scss</a>' file. That's where you can change every styling rules like how many columns you want in your grid system, the width between the columns, the font sizes...</p>
  
  <h2>Mobile first</h2>
  <p>In Kevlr we built everything for mobile first and then the orther screen sizes because we think mobile is the most complex part of the design.</p>
