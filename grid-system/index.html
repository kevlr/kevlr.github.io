  <h2>Flex Grid</h2>
  <p>The particularity of the Kevlr grid system is the columns are in '<a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">display:flex;</a>'.</p>
  
  <p>That means you don't have to worry about clearing floats* anymore, you can reorder elements* and have equal height content without javascript.</p>
